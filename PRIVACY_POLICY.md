# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Thread Grouper

**Last Updated:** August 18, 2025

## Overview

ChatGPT Thread Grouper ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection and Use

### What Data We Collect

**Personal Communications:**
- ChatGPT conversation thread titles
- Thread metadata (creation dates, URLs, thread IDs)

**Website Content:**
- ChatGPT page content necessary to identify and organize conversation threads
- Thread organization data (custom groups, group names, group assignments)

**Prompt Library Data:**
- Custom prompt templates you create (names, system prompts, user prompts, categories)
- Prompt library settings and organization preferences

### How We Use Your Data

We collect and use this data solely to:
- Enable you to organize your ChatGPT conversations into custom groups
- Provide drag-and-drop functionality for thread management
- Store your organizational preferences and settings
- Allow you to export and import your organization data
- Enable the prompt library feature to save and manage your custom prompts
- Send prompts directly to ChatGPT when you choose to use them

### Data Storage

**Local Storage Only:**
- All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API
- No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties
- No data leaves your computer unless you explicitly export it

**What We Store:**
- Group names and colors you create
- Thread-to-group assignments
- Extension settings and preferences
- Thread titles and metadata for organizational purposes
- Prompt library templates (names, system prompts, user prompts, categories)
- Language preferences and interface settings

## Data Sharing

**We do not share your data with anyone.** Specifically:
- No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have any)
- No data is sold to third parties
- No data is shared with advertising networks
- No data is used for analytics or tracking

The only exception is when you voluntarily use the export feature to save your data to a file on your computer.

## Data Security

- All data remains on your local device
- Data is stored using Chrome's secure storage API
- No authentication information is collected or stored
- No financial or payment information is collected

## User Control

You have complete control over your data:
- **Export:** Download all your organization data as a JSON file
- **Import:** Restore your data from a previously exported file  
- **Delete:** Remove all extension data through Chrome's extension settings
- **Modify:** Change or delete groups and thread assignments at any time

## Permissions Justification

**Storage Permission:** Required to save your conversation groups, settings, and prompt library data locally on your device.

**ActiveTab Permission:** Needed to access ChatGPT page content to identify conversation threads and inject our organization interface.

**Tabs Permission:** Required for the prompt library feature to find existing ChatGPT tabs or create new ones, and to send prompts directly to ChatGPT. Also needed for popup communication with content scripts and multi-tab synchronization of settings and data.

**Host Permissions (chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com):** Required because the extension only works on ChatGPT websites where conversation threads exist.

**Notifications Permission:** Used only to display a welcome notification when first installed.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.
